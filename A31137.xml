            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF The City of Oxford: SHEWING How far the ſaid CITY is Concerned to Oppoſe the Confirmation of the CHARTERS, and Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Priviledges of the Univerſity by PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p n="1">I. BY a Charter bearing date the 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> day of <hi>March</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Car.</hi> 1<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">mi</hi>.</hi> the ſole Licenſing of Taverns is Granted to the Univerſity, and all Magiſtrates and others within or without the Univerſity (except the Chancellor, and his Vice-Chancellor) are prohibited to intermeddle with the Licenſing of Vintners in <hi>Oxford;</hi> and none are to Licenſe any Ale-houſes there, but by the Expreſs conſent of the Chancellor, or Vice-Chancellor; and by colour of this Grant they do Licenſe Ale-houſe-keepers, and take Recognizances, but did never Return any of them to the Quarter-Seſſions until about ten years laſt paſt, and have ſince Returned the ſame but ſeldom. Whereas by the Stattue made 7<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Edw.</hi> 6th. the Power of Granting Wine-Licenſes in <hi>Oxford</hi> is Veſted in the City; and alſo by the Ancient Charters of the ſaid City, none that is not of the Guild of the ſaid City ought to ſell any Wine by Retail in the ſame; and the Magiſtrates of the ſaid City, by ſeveral Acts of Parliament, have Power, as Their Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace, to Licence Inns and Ale-houſes within the ſaid City.</p>
            <p n="2">II. By the ſaid Charter it is Granted, that the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, or Proctors, ſhall have Power to ſearch by Day or by Night for ſuſpicious perſons, and for ſuch as can give no Account of themſelves, and to puniſh ſuch as are faulty by Impriſonment, Baniſhment, or otherwiſe, with a Mandate to the Mayor and Officers of the Town to be Aſſiſtant to the ſearch after ſuch Offenders; and by colour of this Charter, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Cuſtom they claim a Power to Impoſe Forty ſhillings upon any (whether Citizen or Stranger) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> being out of his Houſe or Lodging after Nine of the Clock; which they have Exerciſed not only upon Private Citizens, but upon the Magiſtrates of the City in the Execution of their Offices, and have Impriſoned the Conſtables for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Watch and Ward according to the Statute of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> which is a great Invaſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Liberty of the Subject, and hath been often ſo declared in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is humbly hoped this Parliament will not Affirm the ſame by a Law.</p>
            <p n="3">III. By the ſaid Charter the Clerkſhip of the Market is Granted to the Univerſity, with free Power to Diſpoſe of the Stalls and Standing-Places in the Markets, to have the full Government of the Markets, and to take Toll in the Markets; Whereas the Univerſity hath only a Title to the Clerkſhip of the Market, (and that did Anciently belong to the City;) but the Markets, and the Placing of them, and all Stallage, Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage, and Toll, and all others Profits therein, by ancient Uſage and Preſcription, do yet belong unto the City; and for the Profits thereof, the City doth Pay a large Fee-Farm to Their Majeſties. So that in caſe the ſaid Charter ſhall be confirmed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſaid City will looſe the ſaid Markets and Profits ariſing thereby, which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable part of that Revenue, whereby the Corporation is maintained and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56927:2"/>
            <p n="4">IV. Power is given to the Univerſity, by the ſaid Charter, to hold a Court-Leet, or view of Frank Pledge as well over the Town, and all the Inhabitants as over the Univerſity; that it ſhall be a full and compleat Leet, and that the Univerſity ſhall have the Perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites thereof, and Power to Diſtrain for the ſame. Whereas the City hath Five Leets, one Abſolute and Compleat for North-gate Hundred, and four other for the Four Wards within the City, and therein have all the Power of Leets; Except, <hi>1ſt.</hi> the Enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Aſſize and Aſſay of Bread, Beer, and Wine. <hi>2d.</hi> The Examination of Weights and Meaſures. <hi>3d.</hi> The Puniſhment of Fore-ſtallers, and Regraters. <hi>4th.</hi> The Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Putrid Victuals. <hi>5th.</hi> The Puniſhment of thoſe who wear Arms in the Univerſity; And, <hi>6th.</hi> the Survey of the High-ways, and Streets; which being Anciently likewiſe in the City, were 29<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Edvardi</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> ſurrendered into the King's Hands, and by Him Granted to the Univerſity; and for theſe Six Points the Univerſity have ever ſince 29<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Edvardi 3d.</hi> held a qualified Leet over the City and Suburbs, for ſo much, and for ſo many Things and Inquiries as were given to the Univerſity 29<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Edvardi 3d.</hi> And this Leet is to be ſerved by a mixt Jury, one half Priviledged Men, and the other half Free; and the Penalties impoſed by the ſaid Univerſity in this Leet are to be Eſtreated, and ſent to the City, and to be Levied by them to their own uſe towards their Fee-Farm.</p>
            <p n="5">V. By the ſaid Charter it is Granted, that the Univerſity ſhall have Power to make Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Laws to bind all the Inhabitants in the ſaid City. Whereas the City and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity are Two diſtinct Corporations, and the one in no ſort Subordinate to the other; and therefore it is not reaſonable that the Citizens ſhould be bound by Laws, which they never conſented to by themſelves or their Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. By the ſaid Charter a Grant is made to the Univerſity of Two Coroners. Whereas, time out of mind, the City hath had Two Coroners, who have ſate upon all Perſons, as well Priviledged as Free, until the making the ſaid Charter; and therefore the City having an Intereſt in the Coroners before the ſaid Grant, the Grant to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity is void, and Inquiſitions taken under their Grants <hi>Coram non Judice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. By the ſaid Charter Towns-men are to be Anſwerable for their Families in Buying and Selling all Wares, where either Party is a Scholar; and alſo for all ſuch perſons as they ſhall harbour in their Houſes above three Nights; and no Towns-man is to Build any Cottages without the Expreſs leave of the Chancellor, or Vice-Chancellor, which are Reſtraints inconſiſtent with the Liberty of a Free-man of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The Univerſity hath likewiſe by the ſaid Charter a Grant of Felons Goods, and Power to ſearch and ſeize ſuch Goods; whereas the City doth claim the ſame by Charters more Ancient than any the Univerſity pretend to claim by; and the Univerſity them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under their Common Seal, have Granted, that Felons Goods do belong unto the City, towards their Fee-farm; And the City having the Charge and Cuſtody of keeping the Goal, and being liable to Eſcapes, and being at the Expence of holding Seſſions of the Peace, and Goal-delivery four times in the Year, and the Execution of Priſoners; it may ſeem unreaſonable that the Univerſity ſhould have the Profit of thoſe things, which uſually belong to other Cities in the ſame circumſtances.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. The Univerſity doth pretend to have a Power to Diſcommon Citizens at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to inhibit all Priviledged perſons to have any Commerce or Trading with them, which they ſometimes uſe, to the ruine of the Citizens and their Families.</p>
            <p n="10">X. By the ſaid Charter it is Granted, that Scholars, their Servants, and the Servants of the Univerſity, ſhall not be forced to Appear at Muſters, or contribute thereunto; and that they ſhall be Diſcharged of Subſidies, Reliefs, Impoſitions, and Contributions.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. The Univerſity, by means of a Compoſition made ſhortly after the Conflict 29<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Edw. 3d.</hi> and Confirmed by the ſaid Charter do require the Mayor, and 62 Citizens with him, Yearly upon <hi>Scholaſticas</hi>-Day, (which is the Tenth day of <hi>February</hi>) to make an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation there upon the High Altar of 63 Pence for the Souls of 63 Scholars ſlain in the Time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third: This being in the Original groſs Superſtition, is too great a Badge of Popery to be required in a Proteſtant Univerſity.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. By the ſaid Charter it is Granted, that Scholars or Priviledged perſons ſhall not be Impleaded in the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for ſuch things as the Chancellor hath cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of; and that they ſhall be diſmiſſed from thence without Pleading their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56927:2"/>or paying their Fees, which doth often fall out to be a very great Oppreſſion to the Officers, and Miniſters of Juſtice; for if upon demand of the Vice-Chancellor they do not diſcharge ſuch Priviledged perſon, the Vice-Chancellor, by colour of this Clauſe, doth Impriſon the Bailiff; as on the 20th of <hi>October</hi> laſt he did one <hi>Edward Adams,</hi> a Sworn Bailiff, for not diſcharging <hi>Henry Wildgooſe,</hi> who was Arreſted at the Suit of the City, by a Writ Iſſuing out of the Court of Common-Pleas; and by colour of the ſaid Clauſe, if any perſon Sue a priviledged Man in any of the Courts of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> the ſaid Vice Chancellor doth Cite the Plaintiff into the Court of the Univerſity for Breach of their Statutes, and doth condemn him in Expences for Suing a Priviledged perſon out of the Univerſity.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. By the ſaid Charter it is Granted, that Priviledged men ſhall have as much Liberty to Trade as the Freemen of the ſaid City, and by colour of this Grant, the ſaid Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity do take upon them to ſet up Trades, and to Licenſe certain Perſons whom they call Priviledged Perſons, openly to uſe Trades, and to ſell Merchandizes within the ſaid City, and Suburbs by Retail, which is contrary to the ancient Charters, Cuſtoms, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the ſaid City, and to certain Compoſitions and Agreements made between the ſaid Univerſity and City.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. Whereas by certain Compoſitions heretofore made between the ſaid Univerſity and City, the Menial Servants of all Schollers, and all their other Servants taking Wages without Fraud or deceit, are to enjoy the Priviledge of the Univerſity, the ſaid Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon pretence, of later Grants have fraudulently, and with an intent to weaken the Government of the ſaid City, Granted colourable Priviledges to divers Members of the City, and upon pretence that they were become the under Groom, Gardiner, or Officer of ſome Colledge; have Matriculated them, and whilſt they have continued Members of the City, have adminiſtred unto them an Oath to the effect following, <hi>viz.</hi> You ſhall ſwear, That you ſhall not attempt any Cauſe of yours before the Mayor, or Bayliffs of <hi>Oxford,</hi> neither ſhall you Anſwer before any of them as your Judge, ſo long as you ſhall continue a Priviledged perſon. So God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in terms is repugnant to the Oath which every Freeman of the City doth take at the time of his Admiſſion into the Liberties of the ſaid City; and particularly they have within the ſpace of three Months laſt paſt, Matriculated one <hi>William Turton,</hi> upon pretence that the ſaid <hi>William Turton</hi> was Gardiner of <hi>Exeter</hi>-Colledge: Whereas the ſaid <hi>William Turton</hi> was and yet is a Freeman of the ſaid City, and doth continue to uſe the Trade of a Vintner, and obtained the Title of the ſaid Office, only to avoid the bearing ſuch Offices in the ſaid City, as his Condition and Subſtance had made him capable of. Alſo one <hi>Henry Wildgooſe</hi> a Freeman, and one of the Common-Council of the ſaid City, being apprehenſive that he ſhould be choſen into the Office of Chamberlain of the ſaid City, to avoid the ſame about two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Election for the ſaid Office, did procure himſelf to be Matriculated, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that he was a Groom to one Doctor <hi>Iriſh,</hi> although the ſaid <hi>Henry Wildgooſe</hi> did, and yet doth continue the Trade of a Painter, within the ſaid City; and hath no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relation to the ſaid Dr. <hi>Iriſh,</hi> than to protect himſelf againſt the ſaid City; and by colour of the ſaid Matriculation, the ſaid <hi>Henry Wildgooſe</hi> being Elected Chamberlain of the ſaid City, did and yet doth refuſe to accept the ſaid Office, and is protected in his Diſobedience by the Univerſity, by which means other Citizens are encouraged to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves from their Majeſties Service in the ſaid City.</p>
            <p>It is to be noted that in 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the ſaid Univerſity by the means of Cardinal <hi>Woolſey,</hi> did obtain a Charter, which Granted unto them an Arbitrary Power in their Courts, and many things which were the undoubted Rights of the City, and was very injurious to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Citizens; the Univerſity in 22 <hi>H.</hi> 8. laboured to obtain a Confirmation of this Charter in Parliament but in vain; a Bill was brought in for that purpoſe, but rejected; and afterwards the ſaid City having Exhibited a Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> againſt the ſaid Univerſity, and thereby complained that the ſaid Charter was deſtructive of all their Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; the ſaid Univerſity anſwered, That although the King by means of the ſaid Cardinal had Granted the ſaid Charter, yet they had not, nor ever intended to put the ſame in Execution. Nevertheleſs the ſaid Univerſity 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> prevailed for a Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſaid Charter by Parliament; in like manner the ſaid Univerſity by the means of Doctor <hi>Laud</hi> then Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> did obtain the ſaid Charter 11 <hi>Car.</hi> I. and have ſuppreſſed the ſame ever ſince without attempting to get it Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But now upon pretence of ſecuring themſelves againſt the dangers of Popery and Arbitrary Government, have obtained leave to bring in a Bill for the Confirmation of their Charters; and have brought in a Bill for that purpoſe, and thereby it is Enacted that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56927:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſaid Charter 11 <hi>Car.</hi> I. ſhall be good, effectual and available in the Law to all intents and purpoſes as amply, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if the ſame were recited <hi>Verbatim</hi> in the ſaid Act; with a Proviſo that the ſaid Act ſhall not extend to the prejudice of the Priviledges and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Right belonging to the Mayor and Burgeſſes of the ſaid City, (which is not the name of the ſaid Corporation) but that they ſhall be free in ſuch ſort as they were before the making of the ſaid Act. By which Charter and Bill (if it paſs into a Law) all the Rights and Cuſtomary Priviledges of the ſaid City will be veſted in the ſaid Univerſity, and the Citizens of <hi>Oxford</hi> (who are Members of a diſtinct Corporation) will become ſubject to the Univerſity; nor will the Proviſo in the ſaid Act be any ſecurity unto them, for many of the Priviledges of the ſaid City will not be ſaved or affected by it; and the City of <hi>Oxford</hi> being Intituled unto the ſeveral Priviledges before ſpecified (except Felons Goods, and the power of granting Wine-Licenſes) by uſage and preſcription only, they can never hereafter have any benefit of that Proviſo, or intitle themſelves unto any thing comprized in that Charter, without proving the particular Uſage and Cuſtom at the time of making the ſaid Act, which in a ſhort time will be impoſſible for them to do, but the Proviſo will ſerve only to engage the two Bodies in continual Diſputes and Controverſies.</p>
            <p>The Citizens of <hi>Oxford</hi> do with as much zeal deſire the Eſtabliſhment of the ſaid U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity, and their ſecurity againſt Popery, and Arbitrary power, as any of their own Members; but in regard nothing is granted by the ſaid Charter 11 <hi>Car.</hi> I. which may conduce to thoſe ends, but the ſame doth tend only to give them Dominion over the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and to inveſt them with the Liberties and Franchizes which of Right do belong unto the ſaid City, the Citizens of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who in all circumſtances have behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with as much courage, reſolution and conſtancy in defence of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> as any of the ſaid Univerſity, do Humbly hope that they may have the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the preſent Government, and that being Members of one of His Majeſties Free Cities, they may partake in that common Liberty which he hath purchaſed for all the People of <hi>England.</hi>
